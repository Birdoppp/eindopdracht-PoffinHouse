                    quality of the Poffin depends on the Berries you choose and how well you perform in the mixing
                    mini-game. Your Pok√©mon will gain 1 Sheen everytime they eat a Poffin with the max of 12 Sheen. It
                    is advisory to feed only strong Poffins to a Pok√©mon training for the Super Contest to maximize
                    effectiveness on their Contest Condition, as Sheen can not be decreased or reset.

                    Pok√©mon compete in 5 different categories named after the Contest Conditions: Coolness, Beauty,
                    Cuteness, Cleverness, or Toughness. The contests consist of 3 rounds: Visual, Dance and Acting. For

                        It is important to know that every Poffin Flavor influences a different Contest Condition.
                        Feeding a Sweet Poffin would not be of much help to a Pok√©mon training for the Cool
                        championships. <br/><br/>
                        {/* eslint-disable-next-line react/no-unescaped-entities */}
                        It is favorable when your Pok√©mon's liked Flavor matches the Contest category it would like to
                        compete in. Below you find Empoleon, a avid contestant in the Super Contests.

                </OpeningElement>

                {/* eslint-disable-next-line react/no-unescaped-entities */}
                <article>According to the Trainer Memo (second screen in the Pok√©dex), Empoleon "likes Sweet food".
                    Unfortunately it does
                    not show you what Flavor it dislikes. This is useful to know because feeding a Pok√©mon a Poffin they
                    will dislike, will regress their
                    progress. We have provided a table which includes disliked Flavor in <Link
                        to="/preferences#preferences"
                        className="pink-link">preferences</Link>.
                    <br/><br/>
                    In the Contest Moves (The yellow tab in the Pok√©Dex) it is notable that Empoleon has acces to 3
                    Beauty Contest Moves yet has a wide collection of Ribbons. With dedication and effort your Pok√©mon
                    {/* eslint-disable-next-line react/no-unescaped-entities */}
                    is not confined to 1 Contest Category. The last tab shows Empoleon's Effort Ribbon, one well
                    deserved indeed.
